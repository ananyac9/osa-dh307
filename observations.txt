EEG F3-A2
-no notable patterns

EEG F4-A1
-no notable patterns

EEG A1-A2 has higher amplitude signals for severe and moderate
- severe has equal + and - oscillations (5 to -5)
- moderate has higher on + side than - side (5 to -2.5)
- for normal and mild it is near 0

EEG C3-A2
-amp for moderate is min for some reason

EEG C4-A1
-amp for moderate is min for some reason

EEG O1-A2
-no notable patterns

EEG O2-A1
-same data as O1-A2

EMG CHIN

EOG LOC 2
-no notable patterns

EOG ROC 2 
-no notable patterns

LEG 1
-almost uniform for all except for a spike in severe

LEG 2
-broad spike in severe, but weird patterns

ECG I 
-mild and normal have high amps, followed by severe then moderate

ECG II
-normal has highest amp

ECG IIHF
-normal has highest amp

RR
-almost equal amps for all
-small differences, normal has lowest mean rr, severe has highest

SNORE
-v high amps suddenly for severe, considerable amp throughout
-negligible amp for normal, no snoring
-moderate has a small amplitude of snoring throughout
-mild mein its mostly no snoring but there are short bursts of snoring

FLOW PATIENT 1
-no notable patterns

FLOW PATIENT 2
-no notable patterns

FLOW PATIENT 3
-no notable patterns

EFFORT THO
-highest amp for severe
-stabilises at higher time hours

EFFORT ABD
-highest amp for moderate 

SPO2
-mean spo2 quite low for severe
-severe has lot of fluctuations
-mild slight fluctuations
-moderate bit more 
-normal close to nil fluctuations

PLETH
-severe>moderate~mild>normal

XPAP CPAP/IPAP/EPAP
-max fluctuation in severe then moderate then mild, normal ka 0 line pe hai
-fluctuations start after a few hrs

LEAK TOTAL
-starts after a few hrs
- sev>mod>mild>normal (mean vals)

PULSE RATE
-near constant for normal
-decreases for others
- avg in order normal>mild>moderate>severe
